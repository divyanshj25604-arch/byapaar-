🏦 Byapaar

Empowering Bharat’s Business Backbone through Digital Finance

Byapaar is a modern fintech web platform designed to simplify and accelerate financial operations for India’s MSMEs. Inspired by platforms like Razorpay and Zerodha, Byapaar aims to bridge the financial gap for small businesses through transparency, automation, and accessibility.

The project currently includes a clean, responsive landing page with sections for About, Products, and Contact, along with a dedicated login page for users. Future updates will introduce dynamic JavaScript functionalities such as a personalized MSME dashboard, invoice factoring tools, and a digital credit marketplace that connects businesses with verified lenders.

Byapaar also plans to integrate innovative modules like blockchain-based escrow payments for secure transactions, a cross-border payments system for global trade, and a financial wellness hub to help MSMEs analyze and optimize cash flow. Developers and partners will be able to explore an API marketplace and other smart financial tools built on scalable architecture.

This project is developed as part of the SNW Capstone initiative to demonstrate the application of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in building real-world web applications. The initial phase focuses on static design, while future versions will bring interactivity and data-driven insights.
